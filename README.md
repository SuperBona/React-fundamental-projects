# React Fundamental Projects

- each project contains final/starter
- final - complete app without comments
- starter - complete projects in which I commented all the steps and the theoretical part of what was applied
- all projects built with VITE (boilerplate)
- the apps created are part of an online course that I took, so they are not owned by me

- install deps

```sh
npm install
```

- spin up dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Steps

- in README.md there are all the steps of projects and useful informations


#### Size

- each project is separate entity and contains it's own package.json and node_modules
- I delete this folder from my laptop due to space issues, so the apps from the starter folders contain all the information used during the study and creation of these projects


#### CSS

- some projects will contain more css content (no other option)
- Global Styles
